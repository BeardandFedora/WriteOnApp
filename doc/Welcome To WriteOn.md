## Rich, yet minimalistic

WriteOn is an digital machine made for writing. The refined text editor and writing style of WriteOn helps the author focus on the writing, while visualizing the shape and tone in real-time.


## Just enough control

WriteOn provides a set of hand crafted formatting buttons and shortcuts in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) style editor. WriteOn has just the right number of controls to let you focus on writing and not formatting.

## Scroll writing

Jack Kerouac typed [On the Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Road) on a single roll of paper so he would not be interrupted. [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway) wrote standing up, and [J.R.R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien) liked to write from his attic and even stated in his forward to Lord of the Rings that "*the cost of professional typing by the ten-fingered was beyond my means.*" WriteOn was built for writers like these.

WriteOn works on any device that makes sense to write on, in any position, sitting or standing. WriteOn's unique ***live scroll*** writing approach gives you the option to to keep your work in close view. This is a time saving feature for authors who like to edit their own work and are responsible for doing so. 

WriteOn is crafted to the feel of the typewriter, while adapting to the computer and tablet environment to meet the demands of a highly mobile reality for today's authors, writers, teachers, students, researchers and journalists.



## Built-in spell checking

WriteOn uses your browserâ€™s built-in spell-checker to perform efficient, multi-language spell-checking and correction suggestions. 

## Fully customizable

WriteOn offers author-enhanced features to provide you the right combination of options and tools to be truly personalized - made by you and shared with others. For the technical savvy, WriteOn gives you the freedom to make your own extensions and themes, and share it with others.

# Made by authors.
WriteOn was conceived by people who need to write. We spend considerable time testing the ideas of well established and opinionated authors, writers, editors, teachers, students, journalists, tech writers, bloggers, activists, hackers, and growth hackers. WriteOn is conceived as the ideal writing experience for being productive, mobile, and more free to create freely.


## Publish instantly

One key part of writing is *editing* and *pubishing*. Without them, no one would ever read what is written. 

WriteOn easily uploads stories to Google Drive or Dropbox, and it will publish to popular online platforms like Ghost, Blogger, GitHub, Tumblr, WordPress and more. You can choose whether to upload in markdown format, HTML, or to format the output using the WriteOn template engine.

## Simultaneous collaboration

Stories in WriteOn can be synchronized and shared instantly, whether directly through WriteOn or through Google Drive and Dropbox. When two collaborators are working on the same story at the same time, WriteOn takes care of merging the modifications.


## Review comments

WriteOn allows you to insert inline comments and embed editorial or collaborator discussions directly in your stories. This is a proven method to edit and publish more quickly and efficiently. When writers, assistants, and editors are all collaborating with WriteOn, your dashboard tells you how much time you save. Simple, elegant, non-obtrusive.

## Write offline & on the go

When you travel or are on location, WriteOn is still accessible and lets you write offline just like any other desktop application. WriteOn works in your browser and on your Operating System, and was built for distraction free, offline writing. Simple options let you choose whether to enforce or subtly suggest a *noise free* writing environment, while letting you publish anytime you are connected to the internet.

#Always open and secure.

## Privacy enhanced & newsroom ready

It will become no secret the origins of WriteOn. In this age of privacy concerns and social unrest, today's citizen and news room journalists need a tool they can use - and use safely and securely to inform the public without distraction. WriteOn stores everything you do in an encrypted file on your computer and transmits all publishing and synchronization data through publicly audited technologies such as [SSL/TLS](https://www.howsmyssl.com/). For the more "secure inclined", WriteOn can communicate solely through a [Tor obfsproxy Bridge](https://bridges.torproject.org/?transport=obfs2) by using the WriteOn `Citizen` secure publishing service. 


WriteOn lets you easily destroy your local storage and remove all traces of what you were writing. WriteOn works brilliantly on [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Apple Safari](https://apple.com/safari), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) and [Orweb Private Web Browser](https://guardianproject.info/apps/orweb/)* as a light-weight and secure writing and communication platform for on location, news desk and citizen journalists.

> *Cookie hijacking is possible by either physical access to your computer or by watching your network traffic. In theory only physical access should compromise your system because WriteOn only sends the cookie over an [SSL/TLS](https://www.howsmyssl.com/) link. In practice, alas, it's way [more complex than that](http://fscked.org/blog/fully-automated-active-https-cookie-hijacking). See the [Tor FAQs](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBGeneral) for more information.

## Secure publishing in the cloud

WriteOn `Citizen` is an add-on service that provides anonymous, secure, and privacy-enhanced publishing options for citizen journalists as well as larger news and media collectives. Safely and securely publish your stories and documents directly to 3rd party servers and services, or as newsletters and websites all while circumventing censorship or information theft. This invite-only service is the new form of citizen journalism and meets most of the requirements of today's demanding independent media outfit and activist collective.

# Extended formatting.

## In-line writing format

WriteOn encourages you to type your stories and manuscripts and add your own inline formatting - without ever having to stop writing. WriteOn automatically converts your writing into an acceptable format expected by agents, publishers, editors, blog platforms, agencies, and more.

You can also see online reference guides of the [MultiMarkdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMarkdown) and [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) syntaxes that are available in WriteOn.
